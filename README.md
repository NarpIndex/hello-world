# Hello World!
Hello from Whee!

This package is meant to tell you that your installation of Whee is correct and running!

Try this after installation:

```
wpm install hello-world
wpx hello-world
```
If you see some text that introduces you to Whee, it's all good!

If you see some error, no text, etc. that means it doesn't.
